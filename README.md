# 42-Cadet
42 libft functions how to write in c: memset, bzero, memcpy, memccpy, memmove, memchr, memcmp, strlen, strdup, strcpy, strncpy, strncat, strlcat, strchr,strrchr, strstr, strnstr, strncmp, atoi, isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, toupper, tolower.
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.
